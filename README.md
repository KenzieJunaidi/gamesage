# GameSage

**GameSage** is a content-based game recommendation system designed to help users discover new games similar to their interests. The system leverages K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Cosine Similarity to identify and rank games based on feature similarity, using data collected from over 6,000 titles via the Steam API.
